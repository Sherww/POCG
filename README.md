# POCG
This repository stores the details of the paper "Towards the Analysis and Implementation of Automatic Prompt Optimization in Code Generation Task". Here are some details about the project:

## Dataset

- This folder contains the dataset we used for our experiment

## RQ1_Human_opti

- This folder contains the code of RQ1 in the paper "Towards the Analysis and Implementation of Automatic Prompt Optimization in Code Generation Task", which is used in investigating the direct impact of optimized prompts on the quality of generated code based on LLM.

## RQ2_Automatic_opti

- This folder contains the code of RQ2 focuses on exploring methods to reduce human intervention in prompt optimization.

## RQ3_Evaluation

- This folder contains the results of RQ3, and the cases analiysis in ccase study.

### Dependency
- pip install torch
- pip install transformers

### Prediction
* The model training and prediction were conducted on a machine with two NVIDIA Tesla A100 80G GPUs. The operating system is Ubuntu.
* Please refer to the paper for the detailed parameters of the model.
